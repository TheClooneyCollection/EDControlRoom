Session-log reset after adding the GitHub `gh` policy note pushed `docs/session-log.md` past its 20-line cap.

### Archived Session Log

# Session Log

_This is the rolling short-form log for recent sessions. Keep entries concise and operational. Hard limit: 20 lines. If a new entry would exceed the limit, append the full current log to `docs/status-archive.md`, then reset this file to a fresh empty log template before writing the new entry._

## 2026-06-11

- Added an `AGENTS.md` rule to use `gh` commands by default for GitHub work in this repo and recorded the policy pointer in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- Added a central Control Room failure-message formatter so routine errors now log `Failed:` plus a plain-English reason and `Try:` guidance; covered station mismatch, route mismatch, and commodity mismatch cases and rechecked the full suite at `359 tests in 0.128s`.

## 2026-06-10
- Fixed the market-routine UX when commodity lookup or station verification fails after opening the commodities market: the routine now backs out to station services before returning the error, added a missing-target regression test, and rechecked the full suite at `355 tests in 0.135s`.
- Switched release/update metadata to the moved GitHub repository `TheClooneyCollection/EDControlRoom`, updated test release URLs to match, and kept the full suite green afterward.
- Updated release-please to patch the root `EDControlRoom` version inside `uv.lock` via TOML `jsonpath`, renamed the Python distribution/runtime metadata from `edautopilot` to `EDControlRoom`, refreshed the Control Room update-status strings/tests, and rechecked the full suite at `354 tests in 0.131s`.
- Added `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` plus manifest/config files so releases are opened as PRs against protected `main`; seeded the manifest at `1.7.3`, documented the optional `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` secret for CI-on-release-PRs, and rechecked the full suite at `354 tests in 0.134s`.
- Added PR-title guidance to `AGENTS.md` and a `.github/pull_request_template.md`: normal PRs use Conventional Commit prefixes, `dev` -> `main` promotions default to `chore: promote dev to main`, and `release: ...` is reserved for versioned release PRs.
- Increased the market commodity-view focus-reset safeguard from `UI_Left/UI_Up x3` to `x5` for both buy and sell flows, updated the routine tests to match, and rechecked timing after the full suite still passed at `354 tests in 0.275s` with no single dominant slow test in `tools/report_test_timing.py`.
- Replaced lingering project shorthand in active docs and user-facing CLI text with `EDControlRoom`, including quickstart/diagnostics/manual-testing docs, the TTS helper description, and one market-routine comment.
- Renamed the active docs surface to `EDControlRoom` and removed lingering old-project branding from README, AGENTS release-title guidance, and the maintained Control Room operator doc.
- Reviewed haul station-automation assumptions: current flow hard-waits on `DockingGranted`/`Docked` for arrival and `Music` `NoTrack` after `Undocked` for launch clearance; routing and FSD engage themselves are independent of auto-alignment.
- Tightened README and Control Room haul docs to describe the commander-facing handoff more explicitly: EDControlRoom handles post-drop station chores, primes the FSD after station clearance, then uses TTS as the ready-to-jump cue.
- Confirmed a CrossOver/Elite bindings caveat for future troubleshooting: if a shared `Custom` `.binds` preset contains controller mappings, Elite may refuse to surface/load that preset until the mapped controller is connected or otherwise visible to the runtime.
- Preemptive trim of `docs/STATUS.md` (Current Snapshot, Active Capabilities, Key Caveats each kept to top 5 newest bullets) and a full session-log reset to status-archive, restoring headroom before the next handoff.

## Archived On 2026-06-10 (session 116 preemptive trim)

Preemptive trim of `docs/STATUS.md` (Current Snapshot, Active Capabilities, Key Caveats) and a session-log reset to restore headroom before any new entries land.

### Trimmed Current Snapshot Bullets

- `bindings_files.py` now provides a quick operator utility to list `.binds` files from the detected bindings folder, copy them into the repo-local gitignored `backup/bindings/` folder, restore from numbered or interactive backup selections, and apply shipped default presets onto the active custom file after confirmation while saving a safety backup first.
- Operator-facing `bindings_files.py` usage now lives in `docs/operators/bindings-files.md`; `README.md` also notes that `apply-default` exists but still lacks live validation against a real Elite session.
- README, quickstart, and Control Room operator docs were tightened around a smaller "start here" surface: `uv sync` plus `uv run python3 control_room.py` now lead, redundant optional-config examples were removed, shortcut/focus/delay guidance is more explicit, and journal/input probe commands are framed as troubleshooting-only.
- `AGENTS.md` now explicitly requires future README section edits to keep the hand-written README TOC in sync, because GitHub's automatic Outline menu is not an inline TOC replacement.
- Windows bindings auto-detection now matches macOS/Linux by selecting the newest `.binds` file by modification time instead of the lexicographically last filename.
- Web-control UI research is now captured in `docs/research/0005-web-control-ui-options.md`, including the current NiceGUI-first prototype recommendation and the iPhone Safari LAN-HTTP caveat from NiceGUI issue `#5802`.
- Elite preset-location research is now captured in `docs/research/0006-elite-bindings-preset-locations.md`, confirming that CrossOver user bindings live under `Options/Bindings` while Frontier's built-in presets come from the installed `ControlSchemes` folder, and that controller bindings are stored as logical `Device`/`Key` tokens backed by `DeviceMappings.xml`.

### Trimmed Active Capabilities Bullets

- Control Room bootstrap now restores commander name from the latest journal snapshot, so opening the UI mid-session no longer depends on catching a fresh live `LoadGame` or `Commander` event.
- Control Room and two-way haul startup now prefer the full journal-derived current station/system over stale `Market.json` metadata, and the shared ship snapshot now retains station name alongside system/status during bootstrap/resume.
- The location-regression root cause and prevention notes are captured in `docs/devlog/0002-control-room-location-regression.md`; the key lesson is that current station/system must come from one canonical journal-derived snapshot rather than ad hoc `Market.json` fallback.
- Control Room `Ctrl-C`/`Ctrl-D` handling is now haul-aware: the first interrupt during `haul` queues a stop at the next station-1 cycle boundary after the return sale, announces that deferred stop, and a second interrupt still cancels immediately.
- Routines: `jump`, `dock`, `undock`, market buy/sell, galaxy-map destination setting, and the two-way haul loop live under `edap/routines/`.
- Hauling: `edap.routines.haul_loop` now aliases the two-way implementation directly; the older one-way haul codepath is gone.
- Two-way haul resume now uses journal position plus `Cargo.json`/`Market.json` fallback data to identify station/phase, distinguish partial vs full outbound loads, and avoid re-buying or replaying the wrong station's actions.
- Docking adds a configurable post-`SupercruiseExit` settle, announces the auto-docking handoff, then attempts auto-refuel plus a one-step repair follow-up before returning to station services.
- Haul departures now auto-engage hyperspace with raw key `k` after mass lock clears by default, and hyperspace arrival can auto-open the left nav panel after a configurable delay.
- Market routines now log supply/demand levels, speak low-stock warnings, reset UI focus defensively, and support targeted sells even when the station is not actively buying the carried commodity.
- `ActionDispatcher` is the single source of truth for repeated-input pacing; raw keys, repeated actions, and `submit_text` all emit separate paced taps there.
- TTS phrases now live in `defaults/tts.toml` with user overrides under `[tts]`; `speak.py` can now smoke-test raw text or explicit `--system-name` / `--station-name` normalization; and spoken system/station names spell `3+` digit runs individually so callouts like `HIP 58412` come out as `5 8 4 1 2` while shorter tags like `B13-2` stay intact.
- Queued TTS now bounds pending backlog in-process and coalesces stale queued repeats by announcement type once speech is already in flight, so long Control Room sessions keep the latest operator-relevant callout without unbounded queue growth.
- TTS title handling now supports `tts.title_mode = "commander" | "custom" | "commander_name"`; `commander_name` uses the detected journal CMDR name once available and falls back to plain `commander` before that.
- The config loader now also accepts grouped control subtables such as `[controls.market]` and `[controls.haul.two_way]`, so `config.example.toml` can stay organized while local `config.toml` files only need the specific overrides a commander wants.
- Windows input injection now builds the full Win32 `INPUT` union shape and surfaces native `GetLastError()` detail on `SendInput` failures.
- CI runs the unittest suite cross-platform and enforces a 3-second full-suite ceiling; `tools/report_test_timing.py` can rank slow tests locally.

### Trimmed Key Caveats Bullets

- Recent live-log review did not reveal a distinct journal or `Music` cue for the pre-drop "safe to disengage" moment; assume CV/vision is required if we want to trigger before `SupercruiseExit`.
- Startup binding warnings intentionally suppress unused maneuver controls (`Roll*`, `Pitch*`, `Yaw*`). Any future routine that depends on them must remove that suppression in the same change.
- The suite body is currently fast enough for the local `0.2s` target, but wrapper startup means timing checks must use the runtime reported by `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`, not generic wall-clock timing around `uv`.
- EDAP still only emulates keyboard input. Any action EDAP needs must also have a keyboard bind even if the operator normally flies with HOTAS/gamepad.

### Reset Session Log (2026-06-10)

- Renamed `edap/routines/_callbacks.py` to `edap/routines/callbacks.py`, added two `AGENTS.md` rules forbidding STATUS.md policy duplication, and collapsed the five duplicate callback-policy bullets in `docs/STATUS.md` into one pointer back to `AGENTS.md` (suite still at `354` tests in `0.172s`).
- Tightened the callback refactor after review: removed production default no-op callback params from routine entrypoints, restricted no-op helper usage to tests/wrappers, updated `AGENTS.md` to codify that rule, and re-ran full unittest verification.
- Callback refactor follow-up: added shared routine no-op callback helpers, made routine-layer progress/announcement types concrete instead of `Optional[...]`, wrapped silent routine tests through explicit no-op adapters, and re-verified the full suite at `354` tests in `0.167s`.
- Compacted `docs/STATUS.md` to restore headroom and recorded the callback-typing rule: keep progress/announcement callbacks non-optional when production callers always pass them, and use explicit no-op callbacks in tests instead of `None`.
- Reworded the repeated focus/delay guidance in `README.md` and `docs/operators/control-room.md` to be more operator-friendly: fire the command, switch back to Elite during the 5-second delay, or use `instant` when running from a remote shell.
- Added repeated operator-facing focus/delay guidance to `README.md` and `docs/operators/control-room.md`: EDAP needs the game window focused because it sends keyboard input, Control Room waits 5 seconds before ship-affecting commands by default, and `instant` toggles that delay for remote-shell use.
- Refined `docs/operators/control-room.md` for operators: added the shipped screenshot, documented the most-used keyboard shortcuts up front, and replaced the old developer-style notes block with shorter user-facing behavior notes.
- Tightened `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md`: moved Control Room launch ahead of probe commands, collapsed repeated config override guidance into one shared note, and reframed `watch_journal.py` / `ship_controls.py --action SetSpeedZero` as optional troubleshooting checks with clearer behavior notes.
- Cut release prep for `v1.7.3`: bumped package metadata, refreshed maintained status/session notes, and targeted the post-`v1.7.2` runtime-hardening slice (bounded queued TTS/session growth, buffered journal-log flushes, injectable version source).
- Added `control_room.activity_log_max_lines` to the Control Room runtime surface: `ActivityLog` now receives the configured retention limit by default, and `ControlRoomApp(..., activity_log_max_lines=...)` can still inject an explicit override for tests or alternate launch surfaces.

## Archived On 2026-06-10

The content below was trimmed out of `docs/STATUS.md` when the startup handoff was compacted and reordered to restore line-budget headroom.

### Trimmed Current Snapshot Bullets

- Operator-facing usage for `bindings_files.py` now lives in `docs/operators/bindings-files.md`, and `README.md` now calls out that `apply-default` is implemented but not yet live-validated against a real Elite session.
- README and the operator docs are now being tightened around a smaller "start here" surface so haul behavior, Control Room interrupt semantics, and bindings-file workflows are easier to discover without reading the full status handoff.
- The current docs pass also removes redundant `--config config.toml` examples from the main operator guides and launcher/probe usage strings; repo-root `config.toml` is now documented as optional and auto-loaded when present.
- README `Start Here` now leads with `uv sync` plus `uv run python3 control_room.py`, points deeper setup to the quickstart guide, and surfaces Control Room + haul context earlier in the page.
- `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` now leads operators from setup straight into Control Room, consolidates the repeated optional-config guidance into one shared note, and limits journal/input probe commands to an issue-driven troubleshooting section with clearer command intent.
- `docs/operators/control-room.md` now includes the shipped Control Room screenshot, calls out the core keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl-R`, `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`) in a dedicated operator-facing section, and trims the previous developer-style notes into shorter usage-oriented behavior notes.
- README and `docs/operators/control-room.md` now both repeat the key operator constraint that EDAP only works by sending keyboard input into the focused game window, including the reason for the default 5-second command delay and the `instant` toggle for remote-shell use.
- That focus/delay guidance in README and `docs/operators/control-room.md` is now phrased more directly for operators: fire the command, switch back to Elite during the default 5-second delay, or use `instant` when that pause is not needed.

## Archive Policy

- `docs/STATUS.md` is the compact startup handoff.
- Put long chronological notes, live-validation detail, deep capability matrices, and extended TODO/backlog material here.
- Prefer appending or regrouping detail here instead of expanding `STATUS.md`.

## Detailed Snapshot Archived On 2026-06-08

The content below was moved out of `docs/STATUS.md` to keep startup context compact while preserving the prior detailed handoff.

### Detailed Current State

Plan 0001 (macOS MVP portability) is complete. The four hard platform problems are proven on the current macOS + CrossOver setup:

- Journal auto-detection and parsing works against a real log.
- Bindings XML parsing and action lookup works.
- Screen capture from the CrossOver window works.
- Synthetic key input via Quartz `CGEventPost` reaches the game, including modifier combos and punctuation keys that broke the earlier `osascript` backend.

A shared runtime context, config system, bindings lookup seam, and a small runtime action surface are wired up. Utility scripts `diagnostics.py`, `ship_controls.py`, `check_bindings.py`, `set_binding.py`, `view_bindings.py`, `watch_journal.py`, and `run_routine.py` all work.

The first journal-driven runtime pieces now exist:

- `JournalWatcher` tails the latest `Journal.*` file incrementally, starts at end-of-file by default, and rolls over to newer journal files.
- `auto_zero_throttle_on_arrival` exists as the first watcher-to-controls routine and dispatches `SetSpeedZero` on `SupercruiseExit`.
- `jump` now exists as the first retrying journal-driven routine. It dispatches `HyperSuperCombination`, waits for `StartJump` / hyperspace start, then waits to re-enter `in_supercruise` and zeroes throttle.
- `dock` now exists as a journal-driven station approach routine. It can wait for `SupercruiseExit`, send the legacy docking-request menu walk, wait for docking journal events, and optionally chain the in-station refuel menu.
- `undock` now exists as a journal-driven routine. It sends `UI_Back x10`, `HeadLookReset`, a single `UI_Down` tap, and `UI_Select` to trigger launch, waits for `Undocked`, then requires `Music(MusicTrack="NoTrack")` before treating the ship as clear of the station (configurable timeout, default 30s for each wait). Recent live logs showed `Undocked` can arrive while docking-computer music is still active, so plain `Undocked` is no longer treated as equivalent to `in_space`.
- `edap/routines/` (1 400-line flat file) was split into `edap/routines/` package: `_base.py` (protocols, `RoutineResult`, event helpers), `throttle.py`, `jump.py`, `docking.py`, `market.py`, `galaxy_map.py`, `haul.py`. `__init__.py` re-exports the full public surface unchanged.
- `run_routine.py` now supports `auto_zero_throttle_on_arrival`, `jump`, `dock`, `station_refuel_menu`, and `undock` as live manual harnesses for exercising journal-driven paths against a real Elite session.
- Undock timeout lives in config: `controls.undock_timeout_seconds` (default 30s). `run_routine.py` flag `--undock-timeout-seconds` overrides config; `control_room.py` and `haul_loop` use the same default. Live control-room / watcher logs from 2026-06-06 showed `Undocked` followed by `MusicTrack="DockingComputer"` and only later `MusicTrack="NoTrack"`, so state reduction and `undock` completion now use `NoTrack` as the strict clear-of-station signal during auto-undock.
- `run_routine.py` now emits live progress to stderr (waiting-for-event, event-detected, key-presses, pauses). JSON output is opt-in via `--json`.
- The current live manual test flows for those harnesses are documented in `docs/operators/manual-journal-routine-testing.md`.

Latest live validation on the current macOS + CrossOver setup:

- raw key injection through `diagnostics.py --send-test-key` was re-validated after restoring macOS Accessibility permission for the terminal app
- `watch_journal.py` confirmed live journal tailing and the expected event vocabulary
- `run_routine.py --routine jump --log-events` captured the expected hyperspace sequence: `StartJump` with `JumpType == "Hyperspace"` followed by `FSDJump`
- `run_routine.py --routine dock --skip-supercruise-exit --auto-refuel --log-events` completed a full dock-and-refuel cycle; live testing revealed a retry-after-grant bug (watcher offset primed too late when supercruise wait is skipped) which was fixed in `edap/routines/`
- Dock routine was further extended (not yet live-validated): boost after SupercruiseExit with configurable settle time, DockingDenied retry loop with configurable delay, `ui_left` after `ui_select` to dismiss the station contact menu
- `run_routine.py --routine undock --log-events` completed a full undock cycle from a docked state
- Follow-up live haul testing found and fixed two routine-edge bugs in `edap/routines/`: market buy/sell now sends `UI_Back` twice with an explicit inter-tap delay after trade confirmation, and the trade / undock waiters now preserve leftover events from the same journal poll batch so immediate `MarketSell` / `Location(Docked=false)` follow-up events are not dropped after the first match
- Follow-up haul-loop investigation found two binding/action mismatches: control-room preload was missing `SetSpeed100`, and boost was requested as `BoostButton` even though the live `.binds` files expose it as `UseBoostJuice`. Fixed by switching the canonical boost action token to `UseBoostJuice`, preloading control room from `DEFAULT_SHIP_CONTROL_ACTIONS`, and documenting the live Elite binding names in `docs/diagnostics/bindings-reference.md`
- Haul-loop departure sequencing now splits the undock completion checks: it launches and waits for `Undocked`, then sets the galaxy-map route, then waits for `Music(MusicTrack="NoTrack")` as a soft clear-of-station confirmation before sending `SetSpeed100` / boost-until-mass-lock-clears. The old configurable post-undock safety delay was removed completely.
- A new symmetric haul routine now lives in `edap/routines/haul_two_way.py` and is the active operator path for control room plus `run_routine.py --routine haul_loop`. It models a two-station loop explicitly: station 1 buys cargo A / sells cargo B, station 2 buys cargo B / sells cargo A, always sells first, then refills outbound cargo before departure. The older directional `edap/routines/haul.py` routine is preserved unchanged for reference while this new path is live-tested.
- Control-room `sell` (no item) now falls back to `Cargo.json` when the live in-memory cargo manifest is empty because no fresh `Cargo` journal event has arrived yet; this removes the mismatch where haul-loop sell could see cargo that control room sell-all could not
- Test-running docs now consistently require `uv run python3 -m unittest ...` rather than the bare system interpreter, after a local verification run showed `python3 -m unittest` could miss project dependencies like `textual`
- `uv run python3 control_room.py` is now live-validated for interrupt handling: `Ctrl-C` during an active routine cancels the worker without closing the TUI, and `Ctrl-C` when idle exits cleanly without the earlier extra-interrupt / stop-exception noise
- Control-room quit handling no longer relies on Textual receiving `Ctrl-C` as a keybinding. `main()` now installs a `SIGINT` handler that marks a pending interrupt, and the app drains that flag on the UI loop to route terminal `Ctrl-C` through the same cancel-or-exit path used by `Ctrl-D`.
- `control_room.py` now persists operator state to a local JSON file (`control_room.state_file`, default `.control_room_state.json`): recent command history is retained across sessions (`control_room.history_limit`, default 20), and an explicit default haul profile can be saved from history for reuse across restarts
- `replay` (alias `history`) is now implemented in `control_room.py` as a scrollable picker backed by structured saved history: Enter re-executes the selected command immediately, `e` reopens it for editing, and `*` on a haul entry saves or clears that haul setup as the explicit default used by later `haul` prompt flows
- Replay/history navigation now also supports `Ctrl-R` to open from the command bar and inline typed prefix filtering inside the picker (`Backspace` removes filter text)
- Control room now supports `instant` as a persisted toggle for command launch delay. `instant` or `instant on` disables the configured `control_room.command_delay_seconds` delay for future executable commands until `instant off` restores it; `!command` remains the one-shot immediate override. Startup now logs `Instant mode on/off — control with: instant` after saved control-room state loads.
- Control-room `boost` and `escape` are now distinct: `boost` fires `UseBoostJuice` three times unconditionally, while `escape` remains the `Status.json`-driven mass-lock escape path (`SetSpeed100`, then poll `fsd_mass_locked` and boost until it clears)
- `run_routine.py --routine set_gal_map_destination --destination "Colonia" --delay-seconds 5` live-validated: two input bugs found and fixed — modifier key was not explicitly pressed/released (caused ctrl bleed-through to subsequent keys), and `type_text` used keycode 0 for every character (CrossOver ignores the unicode string and reads the physical keycode, so all text arrived as AAAA...); both fixed in `edap/platform/input/macos.py`
- Galaxy map destination flow re-validated after re-introducing the Odyssey-style result selection without poll/retry: `type_text("\n")` was no longer reliably committing the search field in live CrossOver runs, so the routine now submits search with a direct held Enter (default 0.2s). Current timing defaults: `open_settle_s` is now 5s, and the shared galaxy-map settle delay is now explicit (`controls.galaxy_map_settle_seconds`, CLI override `--galaxy-map-settle-seconds`) for both the post-result CamZoomIn wait and the post-plot settle wait. This same delay now flows through `dest` and `haul_loop`.
- Important live binding-lookup caveat: `edap/bindings.py::read_bindings()` resolves only one keyboard binding per action, and if both `Primary` and `Secondary` are keyboard entries the `Secondary` overwrites the `Primary` in the runtime lookup. This is now intentionally useful for galaxy-map flows on the current Elite setup: live testing showed `W/A/S/D` pans the galaxy map view while arrow-key `UI_*` bindings move the in-map cursor/focus. Adding `UpArrow` / `DownArrow` / `LeftArrow` / `RightArrow` as `Secondary` bindings on `UI_Up` / `UI_Down` / `UI_Left` / `UI_Right` therefore causes EDAP routines and control-room dispatch to send arrows, which is what makes galaxy-map menu navigation work reliably right now. This is behavior, not just presentation; changing lookup precedence would change live automation behavior.
- `edap/routines/haul.py` now resumes from the detected in-game phase instead of always assuming a fresh sell-start. Startup phase detection reads the latest journal position event plus `Cargo.json`, narrows sell phase to the target commodity only, can continue from buy/undock/transit phases, and is wired through `run_routine.py` plus control-room haul dispatch. Control room no longer hard-blocks haul launch when you are not docked at the sell station; it now delegates resume-state handling to the haul routine. Resume detection is now also system-aware for undocked normal-space states: empty hold in the sell system resumes a route-set / mass-lock-escape departure toward the buy system, and target cargo in the buy system resumes the symmetric departure toward the sell system, instead of trying to rerun an undock phase while already in space.
- Market station verification now accepts startup docked state from `Location(Docked=true)` / `CarrierJump(Docked=true)` in addition to `Docked`, fixing the fresh-login-in-station case where haul/control-room knew the current station but market buy/sell rejected `Market.json` because no same-session `Docked` event had occurred yet.
- Haul-loop buy-station docking now mirrors the sell-station post-`Docked` flow: after the buy-station `Docked` event, the routine waits `settle_s`, runs the same station refuel menu sequence, and only then enters `market_buy`. This change is haul-specific; standalone `dock(auto_refuel=False)` behavior is unchanged.
- Control-room haul launch now handles the one ambiguous resume case with an inline command-bar confirmation prompt: when startup detection sees you docked at an unknown non-sell station and `buy_station` is blank, the operator is asked to confirm that station as the buy station before the haul worker starts.
- Control-room ship-affecting commands now support a configurable pre-launch delay via `control_room.command_delay_seconds` (default 5s). The delay applies once before execution of typed and replay-executed `dock`, `undock`, `jump`, `boost`, `escape`, `buy`, `sell`, `haul`, and `dest`; replay edit and non-ship commands remain immediate.
- Operators can bypass that control-room launch delay per command with a leading `!` (for example `!jump`, `!dock`, `!haul`, `!dest Sol`). The replay/history browser also supports `!` on the selected entry to execute it immediately without modifying the saved command text.
- The control-room refactor has now been restarted on current `main` with responsibility-based extraction instead of the earlier file-size-only split. `control_room.py` is now a thin top-level launcher / compatibility module, and the live app class moved to `edap/control_room/app.py`. Extracted modules now own prompt state machines (`prompts.py`), pure rendering helpers (`rendering.py`), ship/journal event reduction (`events.py`), saved-state history persistence (`persistence.py`), replay-browser UI/state transitions (`replay.py`), startup/bootstrap + market loading (`bootstrap.py`), haul-session bookkeeping (`haul_tracking.py`), and watcher/routine worker plumbing (`workers.py`). `interfaces.py` defines explicit host protocols for command dispatch and routine launchers, replacing the earlier pattern where those modules imported `ControlRoomApp` directly just for typing. `facade.py` owns the legacy `_cmd_*` / `_dispatch_*` compatibility surface, and `ControlRoomApp.__getattr__` proxies those old entrypoints to the facade so tests and older call sites still work while the app class itself shrinks. Prompt/history/replay/routine flags are no longer stored as a flat bag of app attributes internally: `models.py` now defines grouped mutable state dataclasses for prompt flow, command history, replay browser state, and runtime UI state, while `ControlRoomApp` keeps compatibility properties for the older attribute names.
- Control-room right pane is now split vertically, with MARKET above HAUL. The activity log now writes folded `rich.text.Text` lines so long highlighted messages wrap inside the pane instead of spilling past the right edge. The new HAUL panel tracks live haul-loop session data in-process from journal events: current commander balance, current clean-cycle elapsed time, current cycle net profit, completed-run count, average run time, last run time/profit, and accumulated session profit. Resume-started partial cycles are intentionally ignored until the next clean departure from the configured sell station.
- Control-room startup bootstrap now also reads `Status.json`, so current balance and cargo count appear immediately on launch instead of waiting for a later journal event carrying `Credits` / cargo data.
- Ship-status rendering is now two-column: navigation/flight state on the left, finance/cargo summary on the right. The right column includes balance, total cargo, and up to three top cargo stacks from `Cargo.json` / live cargo state, sorted by quantity.
- Haul-panel elapsed time now starts immediately when `haul` is launched, including resume-started sessions. Resumed partial runs still do not contribute to completed-run averages or accumulated per-run stats until a clean sell-station departure / return cycle is observed.
- Windows support scope is now explicitly narrowed: screen capture is still not a current Windows target, but Windows input + control-room command execution are now active follow-up work. A new `WindowsInputController` exists under `edap/platform/input/windows.py`, the runtime input factory now returns it for `runtime.platform = "windows"`, and focused tests cover Windows key translation / modifier sequencing plus runtime construction. This is implementation coverage, not yet live validation on a real Windows Elite session.
- Platform factories are now lazy-imported (`edap/platform/input/factory.py`, `edap/platform/screen/factory.py`, `edap/platform/paths/factory.py`) so Windows and Linux clients do not import macOS backend modules just by constructing runtime helpers. That keeps optional platform dependencies isolated behind `runtime.platform` instead of module import order.
- Runtime dependency scope is now trimmed around the active operator surfaces. `pyproject.toml` runtime deps now keep only the control-room/direct-controls stack (`textual`, explicit `rich`), while CV/OCR, macOS capture/Quartz, and legacy Windows-era experiment deps moved under `project.optional-dependencies.dev`. `requirements.txt` now mirrors that split with commented optional/legacy entries instead of forcing those packages onto Windows/Linux installs.
- `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` now documents both macOS + CrossOver setup and Windows setup paths (with `uv` and without it), including the recommended first Windows validation step: `diagnostics.py --send-test-key` before control-room or routine debugging.
- Docs now make the `diagnostics.py --send-test-key` boundary explicit: it is a raw input-backend probe for a literal key and does not validate Elite action lookup from `.binds`. Action-resolution checks belong to `check_bindings.py`, and end-to-end action dispatch checks belong to `ship_controls.py --action ...`.
- `runtime.platform` is no longer mandatory for normal macOS/Windows use. `edap/config.py` now defaults it from the host OS when omitted (`darwin -> macos`, `win* -> windows`) while still allowing an explicit override in config. Unsupported hosts still fail fast unless `runtime.platform` is set explicitly.
- `README.md` top-line positioning now reflects the current state more accurately: the project is still macOS-first, but Windows input/control-room support is no longer just a future constraint item.
- Linux is now a supported runtime target in config/runtime/test/CI scope. `edap/config.py` accepts `runtime.platform = "linux"` (and defaults to it on Linux hosts), `edap/platform/paths/linux.py` probes common Steam Proton `compatdata/359320` journal + bindings locations, and `edap/platform/input/linux.py` provides an optional `xdotool`-based `InputController` backend. This is intended as an explicit/X11-oriented starting point, not a Wayland guarantee.
- GitHub Actions CI now exists under `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and runs `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests` on `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest`. That gives cross-platform regression coverage for binding lookup, platform factories, input-controller seam tests, control-room tests, and the rest of the local unittest suite.

## 2026-06-08

- Two-way haul startup now infers the active station/phase from journal position, `Cargo.json`, and `Market.json` fallback data. Added regression coverage for station-2 startup cases.
- Added test timing guardrails: `tools/check_test_timing.py`, CI guard for `tests/test_haul_loop.py`, and support for both single-target and full-suite `unittest discover` timing checks.
- Trimmed `docs/STATUS.md` into a compact handoff document and moved long-form status/history into `docs/status-archive.md`.
- Two-way haul now taps raw `k` after mass-lock escape by default to engage hyperspace FSD; added `controls.haul_two_way_auto_hyperspace_engage` to disable that behavior per config.
- Two-way haul now opens the left external/nav panel on hyperspace arrival by default, with buffered journal handoff into docking so arrival detection does not consume `SupercruiseExit`/`Docked` events.
- Added `controls.haul_two_way_nav_panel_open_delay_seconds` with a default 3.0-second wait before the post-jump nav-panel open.
- Added queued TTS announcements for haul/control-room milestones, with typed announcement IDs in code and repo-shipped default phrases in `defaults/tts.toml` merged with user `[tts]` overrides from `config.toml`.
- Raised the default undock `NoTrack`/clear-station timeout to 600 seconds and changed two-way haul departures to abort, log, and announce a resumable stop instead of continuing blind after the timeout.
- Shortened default TTS jump/arrival phrases to avoid speaking long system names: "Jumping to the next system." and "Arrived."
- Shortened the haul-aborted TTS line to just "Haul aborted." and moved the recovery guidance into the haul log message: `replay / ctrl-r`.
- Fixed the control-room HAUL panel regression from the one-way -> two-way transition: cycle profit/time now follow the two-way station flow, finalize on the return sale at station 1, and carry the next run's station-1 buy cost into the clean departure instead of dropping it.
- Fixed control-room haul launch wiring so the configured `undock_no_track_timeout_seconds=600` reaches `haul_loop_two_way`; the live NoTrack progress line no longer falls back to the stale `60s` default.
- Added a control-room haul log line for ignored station-1 sell events before clean departure: when sale profit is excluded as prior-run carryover, the activity log now says so explicitly.
- Changed the default `arrival` TTS phrase from "Arrived." to "We are dropping out of hyper space jump captain."
- Added `controls.dock_supercruise_exit_settle_seconds` with a default 3.0-second pause between `SupercruiseExit` and the docking boost; wired it into direct dock and two-way haul station approach.

## 2026-06-08

- Market sell now keeps the original demand-sorted SELL order and only injects the requested hidden-but-sellable target row into that order when needed, fixing the cursor index path for cargo like `Food Cartridges` without changing the base list model.
- Market sell now sends `UI_Back x4` to reset the menu stack before each attempt, requires a current docked journal state before it starts, and re-checks that docked state after the trade back-out.
- `ShipControls` now interprets `repeat>1` as separate taps with built-in spacing instead of one collapsed repeated dispatch; full verification passed with `296` unittest cases via `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- Repeat pacing now lives in `ActionDispatcher` instead of only `ShipControls`, so direct dispatcher callers and `submit_text` also emit separate delayed taps; full regression coverage was updated around both layers.
- Release prep for `v1.4.0` now also updates `AGENTS.md` to require `uv sync` plus the resulting `uv.lock` commit whenever `[project].version` changes.
- Control-room command parsing now treats only the final token of `buy`/`sell` as an amount candidate, so multi-word commodities like `buy food cartridges` default to `MAX` correctly; unknown and invalid commands are also recorded into saved replay history now.
- Market `buy ... max` now scales the `UI_Right` hold from free cargo space instead of using a fixed 10-second press; the new `controls.market_buy_hold_seconds_per_ton` setting defaults to `0.01` and falls back to the old cap when cargo space cannot be derived from `Cargo.json` plus journal capacity.
- Market buy/sell now checks station supply or demand against cargo capacity, logs normal levels, warns plus TTS-announces critically low levels, and makes the threshold configurable via `controls.market_critical_level_multiplier`.
- Control room reads `Status.json` destination fields into `SHIP STATUS`, displays them as `Destination: system/body/name`, and refreshes that snapshot on a configurable `control_room.status_refresh_seconds` cadence (default `2.0`). Live re-check showed the destination row also appears in supercruise.
- Prepared `v1.3.0` for release after confirming the post-`v1.2.0` two-way hauling, queued TTS, control-room telemetry/status, and cross-platform runtime coverage changes against the full unittest suite (`283` passing via `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`).
- Clarified release procedure in `AGENTS.md`: release prep must also update `pyproject.toml` so `[project].version` matches the semantic tag version without the leading `v`.
- Windows `SendInput` failures reproduced by a user on admin-to-admin Notepad led to a backend fix: `edap.platform.input.windows` now uses the full Win32 `INPUT` union shape and reports `GetLastError()` on failure; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_windows_input.py` and `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_runtime.py`.
- Control room startup now logs the resolved bindings file path/source and emits inline warnings for any missing or unsupported routine action mappings; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_control_room.py` and `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_check_bindings_cli.py`.
- Parked a future validation slice in `STATUS.md`: true cross-platform live input verification should use a small Python receiver app on self-hosted desktop runners to validate modifier/key event order, rather than relying on hosted CI text-entry checks alone.

## 2026-06-09

- Clarified `AGENTS.md` timing guidance: use the runtime reported by the required `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` step as the timing check, and only fall back to `tools/report_test_timing.py` when that run exceeds `0.2s`.
- Added `tools/report_test_timing.py` to run unittest discovery or named targets and report the top slowest individual test cases (default top 10, with sorting and outcome/runtime filters); also fixed the host-dependent runtime fallback test and updated the stale `tests/test_haul_loop.py` `UI_Up` count expectation for the newer market dialog reset flow.
- GitHub Actions `test_timing` now runs `tools/check_test_timing.py discover --start-directory tests --max-seconds 10` so the timing guard covers the full unittest suite instead of only `tests/test_haul_loop.py`.
- Removed unnecessary real waits from the slow `tests/test_ship_controls.py` repeat/pacing cases and stopped `tests/test_runtime.py` from scanning live CrossOver paths when the test already supplies configured paths; `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` now completes cleanly in about `0.15s`.
- Control-room startup binding warnings now show the in-game control label plus Controls-menu path for missing routine actions, and binding lookup now reports mouse-only versus joystick/controller-only cases distinctly; keyboard `Secondary` still overrides keyboard `Primary`, but non-keyboard slots never override a keyboard bind. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_binding_lookup.py tests/test_control_room.py`.
- Control-room startup binding warnings now ignore the currently unused maneuver actions `RollLeftButton`, `RollRightButton`, `PitchUpButton`, `PitchDownButton`, `YawLeftButton`, and `YawRightButton`; `docs/STATUS.md` now calls out that any future routine or CV/alignment work that starts using them must remove that ignore list in the same change. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_control_room.py`.
- Market buy/sell now reset commodity trade-dialog focus with `UI_Left x3` plus `UI_Up x3` immediately after opening a commodity, reducing dependence on where the game initially places the cursor; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_routines.py`.
- Market sell now restores the intended quantity after that focus reset by holding `UI_Right` for `tons * controls.market_buy_hold_seconds_per_ton` (capped by the existing max hold), including `sell ... max` via `Cargo.json`; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_routines.py`.
- Control-room TTS now only announces undock/leaving-station during an active haul session; generic `undock` outside hauling no longer speaks that callout. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_control_room.py`.
- Added `speak.py` as a minimal TTS smoke-test CLI (`uv run python3 speak.py "hello"`) that detects the current host platform before choosing the backend; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`312` tests, `0.164s` unittest runtime) and `tools/report_test_timing.py` after the stricter wall-clock wrapper exceeded `0.2s` on `uv` startup overhead.
- Clarified the intentional market-sell behavior in code/docs: EDAP should still sell cargo the station is not actively buying when `Market.json` exposes a sell price, because that matches the in-game UI behavior for cargo already in the player's hold.
- Added `tools/scratch/scratch_market.py --format json` and `--side all|buy|sell` for programmable market inspection without changing the probe's conservative station-view rules; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`312` tests, `0.149s`) plus `tools/report_test_timing.py` after the `0.2s` wrapper check again exceeded budget due to `uv` startup overhead rather than slow tests.
- Corrected `tools/scratch/scratch_market.py --format json` to emit the same category/name ordering as the default text view instead of preserving raw `Market.json` order, so scripted index checks now match the in-game layout.
- Shortened the default control-room `cargo_loaded` TTS phrase from `Cargo secured. Leaving station.` to `Cargo secured.` so the immediate post-buy callout after a station sell/buy leg no longer sounds like the sell itself triggered departure.

## 2026-06-09

- Web Control Room research is now documented in `docs/research/0005-web-control-ui-options.md`: current recommendation is NiceGUI for the fastest Python-heavy prototype, but iPhone Safari should be assumed to need HTTPS for NiceGUI because of the open LAN-HTTP reload bug reported in NiceGUI issue `#5802`.
- Added `bindings_files.py` as a quick operator utility for bindings-file inventory and backup; it resolves the active `.binds` file through the existing runtime, lists sibling `.binds` files by mtime descending, and can copy one into gitignored `backup/bindings/` with a default `<name>-YYYY-MM-DD.binds` filename.
- `AGENTS.md` now gives `docs/STATUS.md` its own hard maintenance cap (`80` lines), and `docs/STATUS.md` was rewritten back down to a compact handoff so status detail stops accumulating there like a changelog.
- Release-prep docs now explicitly call out Windows compatibility as part of the next stable cut, and `README.md` / `docs/STATUS.md` now record early live Windows validation by community member CMDR VRYAE while keeping macOS + CrossOver as the primary operator path.
- Release metadata is being bumped for `v1.5.0`, with README wording updated to credit macOS live validation to @NicholasClooney and Windows live validation to CMDR VRYAE.
- Market `buy ... max` already used free cargo space rather than full hold capacity; it now also clamps the hold-time estimate to current station `Stock`, so MAX buys stop at the smaller of free space and supply. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_routines.py` and `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`313` tests, `0.126s`).
- GitHub Actions timing guard was raised from `1s` to `3s` after the suite body still passed in `0.290s` but the `uv` wrapper pushed CI wall-clock to `1.529s`; the separate Windows failures came from TOML test fixtures interpolating native backslash paths into double-quoted TOML strings.
- Windows CI fixture fixes landed: TOML path fixtures now use literal strings, `run_routine` CLI tests expect the runtime-rendered journal path, and `AGENTS.md` now reminds future agents to keep new tests platform-compatible. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`313` tests, `0.130s`).
- Control room activity log now pauses auto-follow for 10 seconds after a manual scroll away from the bottom and marks the pane title with `AUTO-FOLLOW PAUSED`; covered by targeted control-room tests and full-suite verification (`318` tests, `0.139s`).
- Two-way Control Room haul had the same class of resume bug in `haul_loop_two_way`: docked startup only checked for the opposite station's cargo, so a full outbound load at the current station still resumed into buy. Phase detection now uses cargo capacity plus commodity counts to resume into undock when the outbound load is already full. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_haul_two_way.py` (`21` tests, `0.016s`) and `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`325` tests, `0.145s`).
- Removed the old one-way `edap/routines/haul.py` implementation and `tests/test_haul_loop.py`; `edap.routines.haul_loop` now aliases the two-way haul routine directly so future work only targets one haul codepath.
- Docking post-touchdown follow-up now does auto-refuel, attempts a one-tap repair from the adjacent station-services tile, returns to station services, and announces `ship_serviced`; verified with focused routine/TTS/config/control-room tests (`137` tests, `0.078s`) plus full discovery (`322` tests, `0.144s`).
- Docking now announces `Engaging auto docking sequence.` right after docking permission is granted and before the routine sends `SetSpeedZero`; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest tests/test_routines.py tests/test_tts.py tests/test_config.py` (`70` tests, `0.026s`) and `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`304` tests, `0.143s`).
- Release metadata is being bumped for `v1.6.0`, covering the two-way haul resume fixes, one-way haul removal, activity-log follow pause, and docking service/handoff polish in the next stable cut.

## 2026-06-09

- Removed redundant `--config config.toml` examples from the main operator docs and launcher/probe usage strings; the docs now say repo-root `config.toml` is optional, auto-loaded when present, and only worth creating for explicit overrides. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`331` tests, `0.166s`).
- Added nested `[controls.*]` config parsing aliases so grouped tables like `[controls.market]` and `[controls.haul.two_way]` resolve to the existing runtime settings, reorganized `config.example.toml` around those subtables, and updated setup/missing-config guidance so `config.example.toml` is reference-only while local `config.toml` can contain just commander-specific overrides. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`331` tests, `0.151s`).
- Prepared release candidate `v1.7.1`: bumped project metadata for the docked-location bootstrap fix, configured-title hyperspace-arrival TTS fix, and docs tightening follow-up. Verified release-prep state with `uv sync` and `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`330` tests, `0.153s`), then paused final tagging/publish for more docs cleanup.
- Fixed a live station/system regression in Control Room + two-way haul startup: the shared journal snapshot now retains station name, Control Room market headers prefer journal-derived docked location over stale `Market.json` metadata, and haul phase detection now resolves current system/station from the full journal snapshot instead of a single trailing event. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`330` tests, `0.159s`).
- Documented the station/system regression in `docs/devlog/0002-control-room-location-regression.md`, including why the suite still passed: tests covered happy-path `Market.json` fallback but not disagreement cases where journal state and `Market.json` diverge.
- Tightened the docs surface for discoverability: README now points harder at Control Room + haul, `docs/README.md` is grouped into start/operator/diagnostics/handoff/reference sections, and the Control Room operator guide now documents the haul-specific deferred-stop behavior for `Ctrl-C` / `Ctrl-D`.
- Prepared and verified release `v1.7.0`: bumped project metadata for the bindings utility plus Control Room/TTS/haul follow-up slice, and hardened the runtime fallback test so local untracked `config.toml` files no longer break release verification. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`328` tests, `0.159s`).
- TTS title selection now supports literal `commander`, a custom configured string, or the detected commander name via `tts.title_mode`; Control Room keeps the announcer's commander-name context synced from bootstrap and live journal events. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`328` tests, `0.162s`).
- Shared journal snapshots now retain commander identity from `LoadGame`/`Commander`, and Control Room bootstrap seeds that field on startup so the operator name appears even when the UI attaches mid-session; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`321` tests, `0.146s`).
- Control Room now appends every consumed journal event to repo-local `artifacts/control-room.log`, so live sessions have a durable event trace even when `watch_journal.py` is not running; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`315` tests, `0.136s`).
- Documented Elite preset locations and controller-token format under CrossOver in `docs/research/0006-elite-bindings-preset-locations.md`: built-in presets come from the installed `Products/elite-dangerous-odyssey-64/ControlSchemes` folder, user-editable profiles still live under `AppData/Local/.../Options/Bindings`, and controller bindings are stored as symbolic `Device`/`Key` pairs with USB identity data in `DeviceMappings.xml`.
- `bindings_files.py` now supports `restore` from repo-local backups and `apply-default` from shipped `ControlSchemes` presets; both flows save a fresh backup before overwriting the active file, `restore` supports numbered or interactive selection, and preset application preserves the active file's `PresetName`/version metadata. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`310` tests, `0.145s`).
- The interactive `bindings_files.py` selectors now cancel cleanly on `Ctrl-C` and support typed prefix filtering in addition to up/down selection and numeric selection; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`313` tests, `0.137s`).
- Added `docs/operators/bindings-files.md` plus a README mention for `bindings_files.py`, including an explicit note that `apply-default` is not yet live-validated and should be reported if it behaves unexpectedly.
- Changed Windows bindings auto-detection to match macOS/Linux: `default_bindings_file()` now selects the newest `.binds` file by modification time, with test coverage proving filename sort order no longer decides the winner.
- Control Room haul interrupts now defer on the first `Ctrl-C`/`Ctrl-D`: the active two-way haul finishes the current run, stops at station 1 after the return sale and before the next buy, announces that plan over TTS, and still cancels immediately on a second interrupt; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`318` tests, `0.158s`).

## 2026-06-09

- Prepared and verified release `v1.7.1`: rolled up the docked-location bootstrap fix, configured-title hyperspace-arrival TTS fix, nested control-config sections, digit-aware location TTS normalization, and the README/docs surface tightening. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`335` tests, `0.161s`).
- Added an `AGENTS.md` rule to keep the hand-written README TOC updated whenever top-level README sections move; GitHub's automatic Outline menu exists, but it does not replace the inline TOC block.
- Reshaped `README.md` so `Start Here` now leads with `uv sync` plus `uv run python3 control_room.py`, points deeper setup to `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md`, and moves the Control Room / haul explanation above the broader repo overview.
- TTS now normalizes `3+` digit runs in spoken system/station names so callouts like `HIP 58412` are rendered as `HIP 5 8 4 1 2` while shorter tags like `B13-2` remain intact; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`333` tests, `0.158s`).
- `speak.py` now supports `--system-name` and `--station-name` so the CLI smoke test can exercise the same digit-splitting name normalization as in-app TTS without changing generic raw-text speech; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`335` tests, `0.154s`).

## 2026-06-10

- Control Room startup now logs the current app version in `ACTIVITY` and can perform a short GitHub latest-release check to gently notify operators only when a newer release exists; added `control_room.check_for_updates = true|false` plus reusable `edap.version` helpers. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`343` tests, `0.153s`).
- Refined the startup wording so the version line says `Currently running latest version (...)` only when GitHub confirms the local release is current, otherwise it says `Currently running version ...` and adds a separate `A newer ED AutoPilot Mk II release is available: ...` line. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`344` tests, `0.141s`).
- Prepared release `v1.7.2`: bumped project version metadata and rolled the Control Room startup version/update notices into the maintained stable-release handoff.
- Refactored Control Room version/update lookups behind an injectable version source so the harness no longer depends on the repo's live release number; restored the historical `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD (session N)` format in `docs/STATUS.md` as `session 56`. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`344` tests, `0.134s`).
- Recounted `docs/STATUS.md` history from the field-removal commit and corrected the restored counter from the provisional `session 56` estimate to commit-derived `session 106`.
- Buffered Control Room's `artifacts/control-room.log` journal mirror so steady-state event appends flush every 20 events instead of every event, while shutdown still forces a final flush before close; verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`351` tests, `0.149s`).
- Added TTS backlog protection in `edap/tts.py`: the queued speaker now bounds pending items, drops oldest stale backlog when full, and coalesces repeated queued announcement types once speech is already in flight. Verified with `uv run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (`351` tests, `0.147s`).
