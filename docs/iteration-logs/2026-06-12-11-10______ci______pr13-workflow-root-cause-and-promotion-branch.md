# Iteration Log

- Area: `ci`
- Title: `pr13-workflow-root-cause-and-promotion-branch`
- Started: `2026-06-12 11:10`

## Summary

- Cherry-picked PR `#13`'s lone promotion-branch-only commit (`chore: update iteration archive`) onto a fresh `dev` worktree branch.
- Confirmed that the missing PR workflows were caused by the promotion PR being created or updated by Actions with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which suppresses follow-on `pull_request` workflow triggers.
- Confirmed the `dev` vs `main` docs conflict is the legacy `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/session-log.md` delete/modify collision from the split-status migration.

## Changes

- Added the generated iteration-archive update commit to `pr13-on-dev`.
- Updated `docs/status/ci-release.md` with the PR-13 workflow-trigger root cause and the token requirement for normal CI on bot-authored PRs.
- Updated `docs/status/docs-process.md` with the current promotion-conflict explanation and the preferred resolution direction.

## Follow-ups

- Merge the status/iteration-log migration onto `main` so future promotion PRs stop conflicting on the deleted legacy handoff files.
- If normal PR CI is desired on promotion and release PRs, create or reuse a PAT/App-backed `PROMOTION_PR_TOKEN` or `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` instead of relying on `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
