# Iteration Log

- Area: `control-room`
- Title: `market-sell-revenue-wording`
- Started: `2026-06-11 15:56`

## Summary

- Corrected the operator-facing and TTS wording for single `MarketSell` totals so Control Room reports sale revenue instead of profit.

## Changes

- Updated the Control Room market-sell announcement path and the default market-sell TTS text to say `revenue`.
- Added a regression test covering the single-sale wording while leaving haul/session profit tracking unchanged.

## Follow-ups

- Live-check the revised wording during a real station sale to make sure it still reads naturally in the operator activity stream and TTS output.
