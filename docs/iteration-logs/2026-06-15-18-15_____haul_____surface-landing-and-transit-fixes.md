# Iteration Log

- Area: `haul`
- Title: `surface-landing-and-transit-fixes`
- Started: `2026-06-15 18:15`

## Summary

- Fixed two haul regressions: intermediate jumps in multi-jump routes no longer count as destination arrival, and explicitly marked surface destinations now hand off for manual landing instead of trying to request station docking.
- Added a sell-side minimum hold floor so small-quantity commodity sells use a reliable `UI_Right` dwell even when tonnage-based timing would fall below 1 second.

## Changes

- Updated `edap/routines/haul_two_way.py` and `edap/routines/haul_multi_leg.py` to match `FSDJump` arrivals against the configured destination system, preserve the next-station nav-panel announcement, and stop cleanly with `manual landing required` for `on_land` destinations after `SupercruiseExit`.
- Extended two-way haul prompt/dispatch state to persist `station_1_on_land` / `station_2_on_land`, and extended the external multi-leg route model/schema/template with endpoint-level `on_land`.
- Added `controls.market.sell_min_hold_seconds` config plumbing and threaded it through Control Room sell/haul entry points into `edap/routines/market.py`.
- Expanded tests across config, Control Room haul prompt/dispatch, two-way haul, multi-leg haul, and market routines; full suite passed at `391 tests in 0.178s`.

## Follow-ups

- Live-check an actual settlement loop to decide whether the next iteration should automate any post-landing settlement UI or keep the current explicit handoff/resume model.
- Validate a real multi-jump haul route in-game to confirm the final-system-only nav-panel open timing feels correct with journal latency under CrossOver.
