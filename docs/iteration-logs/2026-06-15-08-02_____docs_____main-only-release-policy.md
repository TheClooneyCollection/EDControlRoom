# Iteration Log

- Area: `docs`
- Title: `main-only-release-policy`
- Started: `2026-06-15 08:02`

## Summary

- Updated public-facing and maintainer docs to describe rolling updates on `main` instead of a long-lived `dev` branch.
- Documented the tradeoff explicitly: lower workflow overhead for a single maintainer, with tags and clear issue/feature-completeness notes used to signal stability.

## Changes

- Rewrote the `README.md` development section to explain the `main`-only workflow in public-facing language.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to treat `main` as the active rolling-update branch and removed the old promotion-PR naming guidance.
- Removed stale `dev -> main` guidance from `.github/pull_request_template.md` and refreshed the related status index files.
- Deleted the legacy `.github/workflows/promote-dev-to-main.yml` workflow and removed its remaining live maintainer-doc reference.
- Added `worktrees/` to `.gitignore` so repo-local agent worktrees do not appear as untracked publish noise.

## Follow-ups

- Historical iteration logs and generated archives still mention the removed promotion path; keep those references as chronology unless history cleanup is explicitly needed.
- Validation should include iteration-log filename checks after the workflow deletion lands.
