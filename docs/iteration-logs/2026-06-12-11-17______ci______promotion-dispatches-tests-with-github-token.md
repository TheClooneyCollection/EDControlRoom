# Iteration Log

- Area: `ci`
- Title: `promotion-dispatches-tests-with-github-token`
- Started: `2026-06-12 11:17`

## Summary

- Updated promotion verification to stay on `GITHUB_TOKEN` by dispatching the `Tests` workflow explicitly on the promotion branch after the PR is created or refreshed.

## Changes

- Added `workflow_dispatch` support to `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
- Added `actions: write` permission and a follow-up `gh workflow run tests.yml --ref "$PROMOTION_BRANCH"` step to `.github/workflows/promote-dev-to-main.yml`.
- Updated `docs/status/ci-release.md` to document the new dispatch-based verification path and the remaining caveat for other bot-authored PRs.

## Follow-ups

- Live-check one promotion run after merge to confirm the explicit dispatch produces the expected `Tests` run on `promote-dev-to-main--generated-iteration-archive`.
- If `release-please` PRs also need automatic verification without separate credentials, add the same `workflow_dispatch` pattern there rather than relying on bot-authored `pull_request` events.
