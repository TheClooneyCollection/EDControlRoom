"""Grouping logic for the static bindings TUI viewer.

This module is intentionally rendering-agnostic: it produces a structured
``list[BindingGroup]`` from a binding lookup result so that the rendering
layer in ``tools/view_bindings.py`` can stay thin and the grouping is unit-testable
without importing ``rich``.
